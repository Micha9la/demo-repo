# Karel

Karel The Robot is a simple teaching environment for imperative programming basics. The original idea was developed in the 1970s by Richard Pattis at Stanford University
This project started in 2012 due to dissatisfaction with the available Karel environments. Since then, thousands of German university students have been introduced to the basics of imperative programming via this project.
